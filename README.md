Project-1.HTML-CSS
First Project (html &amp; css)
For this project, I wanted to create a simple informative website for my friends' barbershop.
The primary function of the website is to convey their information i.e contact information and menu.

A key feature that i wanted to convey in the style of the website was to associate the colours that they use for their shop with those that would be on their website:

The off-white of the background is the same as the colour of the walls in the shop.
The red of the headings is the same colour red as the sign above the front door and as the barber chairs inside.
The dark gray of the internal & external links is the same colour as the front door, frame of the door and of the seating for waiting customers in the shop.

I contacted my friends and they sent me their logo to use for the site.

The site has four Sections: Information, Opening Hours, Menu and Contact Information. 
-I used internal links to navigate between the various sections. Defining each section.
-I gave each link name (except home) a question which the section the user would be brought to would have said question answered. E.G."When are we open?" brings the user to the 'Opening Hours' section.

To convey the menu and opening hours I used tables and made sure to keep them centred with the text. I centralized the text to keep the feeling of the experience fresh and open.
